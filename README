A Bad Idea: Adding Truthiness to C#

Don't use this for anything real, really.

Depends on Roslyn CTP, you must have it installed to compile and run.

Allows you to use "Truthy" values in conditional statements in C#.

A value is considered false if it is null, the default value of a ValueType, or the empty string.  It is considered true otherwise.

Conditional statements are considered if, while, do, for, and the ternary conditonal.

Again, don't use this for anything aside from play.  It's neat, but dangerous.
